Now a days technology is everything. But technology could not exist without software. Now a days there is a vast amount of open-source resources available to use to learn programming. Although there are thousands of programming languages in existence there are always people out there that have had a lot of experience with programming. Same as learning tools there are forums and websites where experirences developers and hackers volunteer their time to help fix peoples issues. But how to they pick which question to answer where there are thousands of them? That's where Smart and Stupid questions come to play.   

According to Eric Raymond, stupid questions are those that are vague, show no effort, and are easily searchable. It is very interesting to look through Stack Overflow forum without trying to find an answer but looking more into the questions. I came to realize how indepth questions were and the asker actually shows effort to solve their own problem before asking. However I was able to find a very easily searchable quesiton in there.   

"[How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git/6866485#6866485)". 

```
I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git but haven't pushed the commit to the server yet.

How do I undo those commits from the local repository?
gitversion-controlgit-commitundo
```

In this question the asker shown no effort into solving this problem before asking. It is also a question that could be easily found in the internet. On the answers section it can also be seen that they got a very indepth undeserved answer. Another aspect of the question that makes it a stupid question is that by asking *"How do I undo those commits from the local repository?"* they are indirectly demanding an answer which is not recommended.   

On the other hand, smart questions are those that are well-researched, clear, and show that they have put in the effort to solve the problem before asking. An important thing is that you deisplay the fact that you have done things first and have learned something from it. The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one particular problem. Now lets delve deep into stackflow and look for a SMART question.   

"[How to use to find files recursively?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2186525/how-to-use-to-find-files-recursively)"

```
I would like to list all files recursively in a directory. I currently have a directory structure like this:

src/main.c
src/dir/file1.c
src/another-dir/file2.c
src/another-dir/nested/files/file3.c
I've tried to do the following:

from glob import glob

glob(os.path.join('src','*.c'))
But this will only get be files directly in the src subfolder, e.g. I get main.c but I will not get file1.c, file2.c etc.

from glob import glob

glob(os.path.join('src','*.c'))
glob(os.path.join('src','*','*.c'))
glob(os.path.join('src','*','*','*.c'))
glob(os.path.join('src','*','*','*','*.c'))
But this is obviously limited and clunky, how can I do this properly?
pythonpathfilesystemsglobfnmatch
```

In this question you can see that the asker clearly explains his problem and is discriptive on what he has. He also shown what he tried and 

## Conclusion
Software can be very tricky and you may come to a point where you get code errors that after a long time of researching and trying to figure out a solution you can't manage to find one. Eric Raymond brings a good point that I hadn't thought about until now. How can I get help from professionals and structuring my questions such that they are easy to answer and not stupid. After looking at some qeustions in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) I have realized how thoughout some questions asked in the forum are and they can serve as a template for when I need to ask a SMART question. 

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Hackers and experienced developers like hard and complex questons that lead them to thinking

 The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one particular problem.

 Points:
- Display the fact that you have done these things first. What you have learned from doing these things
- Take your time. Read and understand the FAQs
- Prepare your question and think it through
- Beware of asking the wrong question.



According to How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric S. Raymond and Rick Moen (link), smart questions are those that are well-researched, clear, and show that the asker has put in effort to solve the problem before asking for help. Stupid questions, on the other hand, are vague, lazy, or show entitlement to an answer without effort.

Characteristics of a Smart Question:
Well-researched – The asker has searched online, read documentation, and attempted solutions before asking.
Clear and specific – It includes detailed information such as error messages, expected vs. actual outcomes, and what has already been tried.
Well-structured – Uses proper grammar and formatting, making it easy to understand.
Shows respect for the respondent’s time – Avoids excessive detail but provides all necessary context.
Asked in the right place – Posted on relevant forums, mailing lists, or communities.

Characteristics of a Stupid Question:
Vague or ambiguous – Lacks necessary details, making it hard to understand what the problem is.
Easily searchable – The answer could be found with a quick Google search or by reading the documentation.
Shows no effort – The asker hasn’t attempted any troubleshooting before asking.
Demands an answer – Comes across as entitled or lazy (e.g., "Just tell me the answer").
Asks the wrong people – Posted in irrelevant forums or directed at the wrong audience.
Example Comparison:
❌ Stupid Question: "My code doesn’t work. What’s wrong?"
✅ Smart Question: "I'm trying to implement X in Python, but I'm getting error Y. I tried solutions A and B, but they didn't work. What am I missing?"

In short, smart questions are well-thought-out and encourage helpful responses, while stupid questions waste everyone’s time.
