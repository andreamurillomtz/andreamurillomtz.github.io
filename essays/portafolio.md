<h4>Past</h4>

Starting of as a Mechanical Engineering student I discovered my passion for software while working on a research for system automation. I was working mainly with pythona and C which at that time were new to me. I realized that I enjoyed programming a lot more which made me transfer to Computer Engieneering. I have learned so much about differnt types of software in class and out of class. At the beginnng I was very interested in system automation since it was useful and satisfying. Got familiar with markup languages liek HTML and CSS for creating dashboards. I really enjoyed making then but knew that wasn't my cup of tea. My transition then switch to Machine Learning particulatly in TinyML. Machine Learning is something that fascinates me and I'm curious about. I am not only curious on the different model algorithms but also in optimizaiton ways for the models to be deployed onto embedded systems.

Recently I have been workin on a personal project where I developed an iOS app for apple products where I had to learn a high-level general-purpose language that I was unfamiliar with which is Swift. It was very fun to do trial and run while making a project and I believe I got to learn so much from doint it. I don't consider myself an expert in the language by any means, but I belive I can work my way through making an app. That is somehting I love about software engineering, there are many open-source courses and tools that you can use for learning any programming language.
