So. What do you think about Typescript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Typescript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

My first exposure to Javascript and Typescript was 1 week ago. I have learned a couple othe languages such as Python, C, and C++. During the javascript and typescript modules I leared that the syntax is very similar to C which makes it easy to write. I think Typescript compared to Javascript is a good langauge since it is easier to follow when declaring because you specify the types. We haven't had the chance to use Javascript to use for designing a website but i think it will be very useful to understand how it works.
