<h4>Javascript Newbie</h4>

My first exposure to JavaScript and TypeScript was just a week ago. I have experience with a few other programming languages, such as Python, C, and C++ so getting used to the basic logic of programming wasn't very challenging. During the [JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) modules, I learned that the syntax is very similar to C, which makes it relatively easy to write. I think TypeScript, compared to JavaScript, is a better language because it is easier to follow when declaring variables, as it allows you to specify types. Although we haven’t had the chance to use JavaScript for designing a website yet, I believe understanding how it works will be very useful.    

<br><h4>Programming from an Athletic Approach</h4>

Working under pressure has never been something I am good at. Personally, I work best when I have time to think and brainstorm ideas on how to solve a problem. I really enjoy tackling programming challenges, especially when learning a new language, as it helps me get familiar with the syntax. So far, I’ve had a good experience with the first few practice WODs since the problems have been relatively easy. However, I find that stressing about the time limit makes me less productive. I’m curious to see what future WODs will bring, but for now, I’m unsure whether this learning style will work for me.
