<h3>Thermal Measurement System Automation</h3>   
Automated a system developed by a graduate student to enhance data collection capabilities. Integrated a Raspberry Pi microcomputer into the existing setup to simplify the interface and facilitate system automation. Eliminated the need for manual connection of a laptop to the Heat Flux sensor and multimeter by enabling remote system access and maintaining full control through the Raspberry Pi.

<h3>Automation of Gas Adsorption Experiments using Quartz Crystal Microbalances</h3>   
Established seamless connectivity to Alicat Mass Flow and Pressure controllers through serial communication, enabling instrument access and data logging with a Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Developed Python libraries to retrieve device output data via serial commands. Created a Python script to control instrument valves, facilitating automated valve operations. Designed an industrial dashboard using HTML and CSS as a user interface, providing a visual representation of data received from the instrument.

<h3>Liquid Handling Robot Error</h3>   
Analyzed the efficiency of the OpenTron OT-2 Robot by quantifying the fluid loss during pipetting. Calculated the amount of water lost when transferring liquid from a water reservoir to a scintillation vial, identifying potential inefficiencies and providing insights for optimization.
